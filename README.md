# Saffron Tweets
A Twitter bot created for [Saffron Indian Kitchen](http://www.saffronofphilly.com) to keep their followers up-to-date with their latest specials.

## Run Your Own Saffron Specials Bot
After cloning the repository and `cd saffrontweets`, simply make sure the required credentials are present in the environment (access token, consumer secret, etc.) and then run `npm start`. A tweet will immediately be posted to the authorized account with one of Saffron's latest monthly specials, and will be continously posted once every two weeks until you stop the process.
